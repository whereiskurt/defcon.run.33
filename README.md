# DEFCON.run Infrastructure as Code - Template
This is a hobby AWS 'infrastructure as code' project that deploys Strapi/Etherpad/mosquitto applications into a ECS cluster. I wanted to get this out the door incase it's useful to others and to showcase where we are headed with defcon.run 33! :-)

The base cost to run this full-tilt 24x7 is between $2 and $3 day, before scaling ECS taskdefs etc. I tend to spin-up/down the infra as I'm doing development. It feels good to 'zero out' the environment. ðŸ¤·

I think you could use this as a template for deploying most containerized apps, just by looking at the examples that are already working. I tried to strike a balance between 'cut+paste' in the `apptype` concept (`infra/terraform/modules/cluster/fargate/_v1/apptype/mqtt`) but there is likely more to be done.

# Diagrams

## All the things
Looking at this diagram you can see it deploys WAF, CloudFront w/ ALB+S3 orgins, ALB and NLB, ECS. It ties into a bunch of AWS services, they can all be turned off / tweaked (ie. alarms.) 

## More to come...

## How to Run it?
Here are some execution steps below. If you already know `terragrunt` you can use `terragrunt run-all ...` raw etc. or use the `nx` directives in the `project.json` files.

```bash

##1. Replace the defcon.run with a domain you have registered in the [management] account profile 
./setup.sh defcon\.run defcon\-run example\.run example\-run

## Make sure you have `management` for Route53 ns delegation records, 
## `terraform` for IAC state management, and `application` for account 
## resource creation.

## Set terragrunt bucket names
export GUID=123456789 
./source ./env.sh

nx run site:up
nx run site:down

## OR to just apply IAC+deploy code and then destroy in the us-east-1:
nx run use1.cluster:apply
nx run use1.mqtt:apply      #mqtt/etherpath/strapi
nx run mqtt:use1.deploy     #mqtt/etherpath/strapi
nx run use1.mqtt:destroy    #mqtt/etherpath/strapi
nx run use1.cluster:destroy

```
