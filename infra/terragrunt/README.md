# Why???
I thought I needed this code to prepare a dynamo table and S3 bucket PER REGION/ACCOUNT I was going to work in.

I don't. Terragrunt will 'auto create' these resources, so! It's not needed. HOWEVER, one could disable the auto creation of the resources and use these (which is how I started.)
